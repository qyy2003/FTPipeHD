# Confidant: Customizing Transformer-based LLMs via Collaborative Edge Training

This is a PyTorch implementation of the paper.

The code is adapted from paper *FTPipeHD: A Fault-Tolerant Pipeline-Parallel Distributed Training Framework for Heterogeneous Edge Devices* but most of the code is reconstructed to go along with Pytorch>1.13. Besides, lots of new features are added.
